  abstract:
    Many of todayâ€™s programming languages are broken. Poor performance, lack of
    features and hard-to-reason-about semantics can cost dearly in software
    maintenance and inefficient execution. The problem is only getting worse
    with programming languages proliferating and hardware becoming more
    complicated.

    An important reason for this brokenness is that much of language design is
    implementation-driven. The difficulties in implementation and insufficient
    understanding of concepts bake bad designs into the language itself.
    Concurrency, architectural details and garbage collection are three
    fundamental concerns that contribute much to the complexities of
    implementing managed languages.

    We propose the micro virtual machine, a thin abstraction designed
    specifically to relieve implementers of managed languages of the most
    fundamental implementation challenges that currently impede good design.
    The micro virtual machine targets abstractions over memory (garbage
    collection), architecture (compiler backend), and concurrency. We motivate
    the micro virtual machine and give an account of the design and initial
    experience of a concrete instance, which we call Mu, built over a two year
    period. Our goal is to remove an important barrier to performant and
    semantically sound managed language design and implementation.

  title:    "Stop and Go: Understanding Yieldpoint Behavior"

  abstract:
    Yieldpoints are critical to the implementation of high performance garbage
    collected languages, yet the design space is not well understood.
    Yieldpoints allow a running program to be interrupted at well-defined
    points in its execution, facilitating exact garbage collection, biased
    locking, on-stack replacement, profiling, and other important virtual
    machine behaviors. In this paper we identify and evaluate yieldpoint design
    choices, including previously undocumented designs and optimizations. One
    of the designs we identify opens new opportunities for very low overhead
    profiling. We measure the frequency with which yieldpoints are executed and
    establish a methodology for evaluating the common case execution time
    overhead. We also measure the median and worst case time-to-yield. We find
    that Java benchmarks execute about 100 M yieldpoints per second, of which
    about 1/20000 are taken. The average execution time overhead for untaken
    yieldpoints on the VM we use ranges from 2.5% to close to zero on modern
    hardware, depending on the design, and we find that the designs trade off
    total overhead with worst case time-to-yield. This analysis gives new
    insight into a critical but overlooked aspect of garbage collector
    implementation, and identifies a new optimization and new opportunities for
    very low overhead profiling.
