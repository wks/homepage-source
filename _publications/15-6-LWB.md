Yieldpoints are critical to the implementation of high performance garbage
collected languages, yet the design space is not well understood.  Yieldpoints
allow a running program to be interrupted at well-defined points in its
execution, facilitating exact garbage collection, biased locking, on-stack
replacement, profiling, and other important virtual machine behaviors. In this
paper we identify and evaluate yieldpoint design choices, including previously
undocumented designs and optimizations. One of the designs we identify opens new
opportunities for very low overhead profiling. We measure the frequency with
which yieldpoints are executed and establish a methodology for evaluating the
common case execution time overhead. We also measure the median and worst case
time-to-yield. We find that Java benchmarks execute about 100 M yieldpoints per
second, of which about 1/20000 are taken. The average execution time overhead
for untaken yieldpoints on the VM we use ranges from 2.5% to close to zero on
modern hardware, depending on the design, and we find that the designs trade off
total overhead with worst case time-to-yield. This analysis gives new insight
into a critical but overlooked aspect of garbage collector implementation, and
identifies a new optimization and new opportunities for very low overhead
profiling.
