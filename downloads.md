## The DaCapo Benchmark Suite (unofficial)

> (Excerpt from <https://www.dacapobench.org/>) This benchmark suite is
intended as a tool for Java benchmarking by the programming language, memory
management and computer architecture communities. It consists of a set of open
source, real world applications with non-trivial memory loads.

I actively use the DaCapo Benchmarks while developing MMTk.  The new version
23.11-chopin is finally [released][dacapo-official-release] on 8 November 2023
after 14 years.  🎉 🎊 🎈 🍻 ✌️  If the official download link is too slow for
you, you can try my unofficial BitTorrent (BT) file.  Make sure you verify the
file integrity using the [SHA-256 checksum][dacapo-official-sha256] from the
official release page.
