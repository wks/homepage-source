What's the first first-person shooting (FPS) game you played? Wolfenstein 3D?
DOOM? Duke Nukem 3D? Quake? Halflife? Counter Strike?

The first FPS game I played was a game named "摇滚少林系列之七侠五义3D", usually
translated to English as "Rock'n'Shaolin: Legend of the Seven Paladins 3D" (or
"L7P" or "LSP" for short).

The story is set in ancient China, based on the classical novel *七侠五义*, *The
Seven Heroes and Five Gallants*.

Unlike most FPS games, instead using guns, the protagonists use ancient Chinese
weapons, including swords, throwing daggers, and even ancient Chinese coins!
(Yes. Those martial artists can toss coins at incredible speed and kill
enemies.)  The player (and enemies, too) can also use "qigong" (气功), a
powerful technique that manipulates the air (that is, "qi" (气), not to be
confused with the [wireless power transfer technology with the same
name][qi-charge]) and launches fireballs at the opponents.

When I was nine or ten years old, my father got a boxed copy of that game.  It
included several floppy disks and a manual (in traditional Chinese), and I
played it on a computer with Intel 80386, 4MB memory, but no sound card.
