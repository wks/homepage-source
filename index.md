## About Me

I am a programming language and virtual machine enthusiast.

I got my PhD degree from the [Australian National
University](http://www.anu.edu.au/).  I designed the [Mu micro virtual
machine](https://microvm.github.io/).  You can find my publications here.

I worked for [Huawei](https://www.huawei.com/) before.  The [Open Ark
Compiler](https://gitee.com/openarkcompiler/OpenArkCompiler) still
contains some of my code.  (No.  I don't like naive reference counting.
Yes.  I understand naive RC has performance problems.)

You can find my fun projects [on GitHub](https://github.com/wks).
